This script was created to automate the creation of extremely similar PowerPoint presentations for a company, with only a few details changing each time.

Such details are input by the user in a Word document and the necessary pictures are placed in a set of folders.
Then, by double-clicking on the .exe file resulting from this code, the PowerPoint presentation is automatically generated, complete with the original data in the right places, the pictures, and updated dates wherever needed.
An additional interesting feature consists of the interaction with the Google Maps API to obtain a map including two locations: the address provided in the Word document; the closest airport, the distance from which is also provided on the corresponding slide.

The specific files used in this project (the Word document, the sample presentation, etc.), unfortunately, cannot be shared publicly.
